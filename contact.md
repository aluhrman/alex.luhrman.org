Would you like to contact me? Fantastic!

The internet is a public and complicated space, as a matter of principle I try to use verifiably secure methods of communication as often as possible. For more information on how you can engage in safer online commincation please check out the fantastic <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/">Surveillance Self-Defense Project</a> from the <a href="https://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>.

<h3>Meta Proxies</h3>
[Meta data](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/why-metadata-matters "Why Metadata Matters") is like a digital gold nugget for the 21'st century. I have set up a number of proxies that will get me your message while simultaneously protecting both the sender and receivers meta data from prying eyes :) For more info on my meta-bots check out my [github](https://github.com "Meta Bots for all")

<h3>Jabber/XMPP</h3>
Ah yes the federated, decentralized, original chat protocol. If you are like me you probably love yourself some [Off-the-Record Messaging](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/).
